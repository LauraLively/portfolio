      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>Since you're here, you probably want to know about me... 
        I am not that great at speaking about myself, but here is me in a nutshell. I am a photographer and designer
        with the aspirations of becoming a web developer. I am also a mom, a wife and a woman. I have dreams
        of a clean house, without having to clean. And hopes that one day I can look at a sink
        and not have dirty dishes.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love to help other women to achieve theier dreams of being the next mompreneur and get their 
        web presence as polished as possible. I would love to help you design your perfect home on 
        the internet.  
      </p>
